# my-chrome-os
A list of applications and tools that make ChromeOS such a great experience. Full disclaimer: I am using a Pixelbook from Google which means in addition to ChromeOS I am running Linux via Crostini and Android. Influenced by: [obahareth](https://github.com/obahareth/my-mac-os).

**Extra:** [Google Home Mini](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini) to use as wireless speakers instead of having hardwired speakers. If I need more privacy I will use the [Google Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/google_pixel_buds). I also use the [Google Pixelbook Pen](https://store.google.com/product/google_pixelbook_pen) a lot. I use it to draw up ideas for designs I am working on or I'll open a drawing app and use it as a whiteboard replacement. 

**What I love about my hardware:** I really love that my laptop can fold up and become a tablet. I wasn't sure how often I would use this, but as a full time student and worker it's really nice to be able to lay in bed and read my course content. I love that it works well with my other Google products such as my Pixel XL 2. For example, my phone has the ability to unlock my Pixelbook, and I think my Google Pixel Buds can unlock my phone. Finally, The Pixelbook is very light and easy to take with me, plus ChromeOS is pretty secure so getting a virus is not a huge worry right now.  

# Operating Systems
## ChromeOS  
ChromeOS is what you will have upon unboxing a Chromebook such as the Google Pixelbook. While the operating system in itself is not extremely useful for a developer, the new features that allow you to run Android and Crostini are very powerful additions. [ChromeUnboxed](https://chromeunboxed.com/tips-tricks/) has some really great tips] on getting you transitioned from Mac or PC to a Chromebook.  
## Linux  
Ahh, Linux. This is the bread and butter of the setup for me. Without Linux on ChromeOS I would not own a Pixelbook today. To get Linux setup on a Chromebook is a really simple process now. You do this through Crostini, which is intergrated in with a lot of Chromebooks such as the Pixelbook. For tips and tricks on how to install Crostini, head over to [/r/Crostini](http://reddit.com/r/crostini) on Reddit. The community is extremely helpful.  
## Android  
Finally, Android. You are probably familar with Android by now... It's been around for a while and is extremely popular. Having the ability to run phone and tablet applications from your computer is pretty useful, especially since the Pixelbook in particular has a tablet mode. I use this mostly for running Android applications that work well with my Pixelbook Pen... And shamelessly checking apps such as Instagram.
