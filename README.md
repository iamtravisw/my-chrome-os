# my-chrome-os
A list of applications and tools that make ChromeOS such a great experience. Full disclaimer: I am using a Pixelbook from Google which means in addition to ChromeOS I am running Linux via Crostini and Android. Influenced by: [obahareth](https://github.com/obahareth/my-mac-os).

Extra: [Google Home Mini](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini) to use as wireless speakers instead of having hardwired speakers. If I need more privacy I will use the [Google Pixel Buds](https://store.google.com/product/google_pixel_buds). I also use the [Google Pixelbook Pen](https://store.google.com/product/google_pixelbook_pen) a lot. I use it to draw up ideas for designs I am working on or I'll open a drawing app and use it as a whiteboard replacement. 

What I love about my hardware:
